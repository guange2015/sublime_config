# Rails Tutorial Sublime Text setup

These are the steps needed to set up [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) as in the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org). Instructions are for OS X; Linux and Windows users should make substitutions as necessary. (This may require web searches. Please let me know if you find something that you think should be included here.)

## Command-line command

On OS X, you can set up `subl` as a command-line command by following the [Sublime Text&nbsp;2 instructions for the OS X command line](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html):

    $ ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/bin/subl

This assumes that `~/bin` is in your path. If isn't (which you can check using `echo $PATH` at the command line) you can put `subl` in `/usr/bin`:

    $ sudo ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/bin/subl

 Note the use of `sudo`, which is required because ordinary users don't have permission to write to `/usr/bin`. 

On Linux (especially Ubuntu), the command is the same as for OS X; only the paths differ:

    $ sudo ln -s ~/Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2/sublime_text /usr/bin/subl

(You may have to replace the path to `sublime_text` with the correct one for your system.)

On Linux Mint, take a look at [Install Sublime Text 2 in Linux Mint](http://blog.hugeaim.com/2012/03/13/install-sublime-text-2-in-linux-mint/).

On Windows, you can simply double-click the application icon. The setup at the command line depends on which shell you use; see if one of the techinques at the [Stack Overflow discussion on Sublime Text from Command Line (Win7)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9440639/sublime-text-from-command-line-win7) works for you. You might also want to check out the video [Easily Open Files from Windows Command Prompt with Sublime Text 2](http://youtu.be/zcUpdw5_uSY) (I suggest changing `st2` to `subl` to be consistent with the instructions for the other platforms).

## Basic configuration

Open up Sublime Text and use the `View` menu to modify the following settings:

`View > Hide Minimap`

`View > Side Bar > Hide Side Bar`

`View > Layout > Columns: 2`

## Copy auxiliary files

    $ cd /tmp
    $ git clone git@github.com:mhartl/rails_tutorial_sublime_text.git
    $ cp -r rails_tutorial_sublime_text/* \
            ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User/

Setup on Linux is similar, but with a different target directory for `cp`:

    $ cp -r rails_tutorial_sublime_text/* \
            ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User/

On Windows, the target directory is as follows:

    $ cd /tmp
    $ git clone git@github.com:mhartl/rails_tutorial_sublime_text.git
    $ cp -r .\rails_tutorial_sublime_text\* \
            '~\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User'

Note: If using Windows Vista, 7, or 8, you should first copy all the folders and files from the remote repo into your local temporary folder located at `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp`. Then proceed to move these same files to `C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User`.

## Install Sass syntax highlighting

Follow the instructions at [sublime-text-haml-sass](https://github.com/n00ge/sublime-text-haml-sass).

## Set up the theme

Select `Preferences > Color Scheme > User > Railscasts`

## Install the Rails Tutorial snippets

[https://github.com/mhartl/rails_tutorial_snippets](https://github.com/mhartl/rails_tutorial_snippets)

## Install Sublime Text Alternative Auto-completion

[https://github.com/alexstaubo/sublime_text_alternative_autocompletion](https://github.com/alexstaubo/sublime_text_alternative_autocompletion)

## Install SublimeERB

[https://github.com/eddorre/SublimeERB](https://github.com/eddorre/SublimeERB)

## Install RubyTest

Follow [https://github.com/maltize/sublime-text-2-ruby-tests](https://github.com/maltize/sublime-text-2-ruby-tests). Then edit the file `"Theme - Default/Widget.sublime-settings"` in the `Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages` directory:

    $ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
    $ subl "Theme - Default/Widget.sublime-settings" 

In that file, change

    "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Default/Widgets.stTheme"

to 

    "color_scheme": "Packages/User/CustomTestConsole.tmTheme"
